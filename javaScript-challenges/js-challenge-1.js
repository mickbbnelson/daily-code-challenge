// 1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
// Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. 
// Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest 
// characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get 
// creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 
// 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.


// Answer:
// const testArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];


// const printEvens = testArray.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)

// console.log(printEvens)
